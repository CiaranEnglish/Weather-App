# Weather App
 Simple weather app allowing users to find weather information for a particullar region.

 This is a project I made a few years ago that I forgot to upload. I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Python to build it along with Flask and React.
 I used Open Weather Map API Keys to pull the information.

 You will have to register with Open Weather Map to get a free API Key that you can paste into the code to run the app.

 Python server requires python script.py command to start and react server then requires npm start command to get everything live.
